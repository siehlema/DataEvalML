# SenValEva

A repository for various SENsor VALue EVAluation. To achieve that Machine Learning techniques are used.
The applications want to provide basic implementations on how to use Machine Learning to extract information out of simple sensor values.

Used Frameworks:
* Keras for Deep Neural Networks
* Scikit-learn for other types of ML like Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM, etc.

Train Data:
* Currently the train and test data, which is used, has been generated by capacitive sensors. These sensors are used for human-robot-collaboration.
* Information about the distance of an object relative to the Sensors wants to be extracted
* The Data has 5 rows
  * The first 2 rows are sensor values (inputs)
  * The following 3 are distance values of an object relative to the sensors (outputs)
* There is one data-set for training and one for testing

The future work of this repository wants to deal with more and new Machine Learning Frameworks/Techniques to improve sensor value evaluation. Moreover various other sensor values will be added to to test the applications on them.
