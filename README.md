# SenValEva

A repository for various SENsor VALue EVAluation. To achieve that Machine Learning techniques are used.
The samples want to provide basic implementations on how to use Machine Learning to extract information out of simple datasets.

Used Frameworks:
* Keras for Deep Neural Networks
* Scikit-learn for other types of ML like Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM, etc.

Train Data:


The future work of this repository wants to deal with more and new Machine Learning Frameworks/Techniques to improve sensor value evaluation. Moreover various other sensor values will be added to to test the applications on them.
