# DataEvalML

A repository for DATA EVALuation using Machine Learning techniques.  
The provided samples want to show basic implementations on how to use Machine Learning to extract information out of datasets. Additionally it is aimed to find optimal models regarding the different datasets to improve the results. Regression and Classification is treated.

Used Frameworks:
* Keras for Deep Neural Networks
* Scikit-learn for other types of ML like Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM, etc.

Used Datasets:
* Boston house-prices dataset
* Diabetes dataset
* ...

ToDo:
* Use Tpot for finding an optimal model
* Combine multiple framework approaches

The future work of this repository wants to deal with more and new Machine Learning Frameworks/Techniques to improve sensor value evaluation. Moreover various other sensor values will be added to to test the applications on them.
